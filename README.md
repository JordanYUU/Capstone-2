# Capstone-2
This is week 8 of LTCA and consists of the pieces for this week's Capstone project.

This purpose of this capstone is to help me understand how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python and it's libraries as well as Jupyter Notebook.
MapPlotLib will also play a large role in the visual aspect of the final product.

The idea is that we will be taking two datasets, Customer List and Transaction Data, and creating a Python script to clean them. This includes changing record datatypes, expunging NULL/NaN values, and more. -- This is where I'm at as of Wednesday 5:18PM
